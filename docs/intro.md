# Welcome to SecretSwap

SecretSwap is an automated market-making (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) built for trading SNIP-20 tokens (a.k.a. SecretTokens) on Secret Network. Leveraging secret contracts, SecretSwap protects users against malicious front-running and privacy threats, provides access to cross-chain liquidity through an [Ethereum bridge](https://bridge.scrt.network/), a Binance Smart Chain bridge (in development), a Plasm bridge (in development), and reduces fees relative to Ethereum.

In order to use SecretSwap, you will need the [Keplr Wallet](https://wallet.keplr.app/) installed on your browser and at a minimum, some SCRT to begin swapping.

Most swaps are done between two SecretTokens, with the exception of the trading pair that allows you to trade SCRT tokens for sSCRT, it's SNIP-20 equivalent.
